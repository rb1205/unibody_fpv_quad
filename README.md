# Unibody FPV quad

A size class 400 FPV quadcopter assembled over a single piece FDM printable body. Some highlights:

* Good FPV flight performances for its class due to high frame rigidity (comparable to carbon fiber frames) and low inertia moment.
* servo-operated tiltable FPV CCD camera mount with 180° mechanical range.
* Frame has dedicated fixing points for video TX, ESC, cables, antenna,...
* BOM and exploded diagram of the project with all components and screws located, for easy assembly.
* Flight controller settings are included.

## Stats

* Typical flight time is 18-20 minutes with a 4200 mAh 4s battery. 
* Weight is 250g for the frame alone, ~800g for the assembled quad without battery and 1250g with a 4200 mAh 4s lipo battery
* VTX works on 5.8 GHz (diversion 600 mW vtx)
* optional RX antenna guard lets you use those old FM/PCM transmitters working at 35-72 Mhz.
* Battery bay size=50x38 mm

Due to the frame size, you'll need a bigger-than-average printer with a minimum build envelope of 320x300x50mm to print this.

CAD/CAM used for this project is Creo V.2.
